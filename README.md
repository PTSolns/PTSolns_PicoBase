# PTSolns Pico Base & Pico Base + Proto

Documentation and Examples for the PTSolns Pico Base and Pico Base + Proto

The Pico Base and Pico Base + Proto are development boards designed for the Pi Pico. The following outlines the key features:

## Pico Base
- Compatible with Pi Pico, Pico W, Pico H and Pico WH.
- Power LED.
- Reset button.
- Externally power board with female jack or 2-pin screw terminal. Acceptable external input voltage up to 20V.
- When both UCB and external power source a present, USB will be used and external is automatically disconnected.
- 3x interfaces for 3V3 I2C, plus 1 Qwiic connector.
- 3x interfaces for 5V I2C (by use of onboard logic level shifter).
- Can operate 3V3 and 5V I2C on port 0 and port 1 simultaneously.
- Pinout of all Pico pins, including debug pins.
- Can solder Pico directly onto PCB or use headers.
- Mounting holes that can be connected to ground via jumper.
- Debug pin breakout.

## Pico Base + Proto
- All features of the Pico Base.
- Interface for common 1602 and 2004 LCD via two additional mounting holes along the top edge of the PCB.
- 4-Pin breakout of various important Pico pins. These are adjacent to the prototyping section.
- Breadboard-like prototyping section with 30 rows, and 10 columns.
- Prototyping section has jumper pads so that adjacent rows can be connected. Also capable to solder SMD components on jumper pads.
- Seven configurable power rails via jumpers.
